# Must have
 - check types
 - SSR
 - licence
 - readme: contributing
 - docs: automatically bundle Dropzone docs as much as possible?
 - docs: manually cover the rest
 - previewTemplate as a slot
 - .manuallyAddFile(file, fileUrl)?

# Document
- TS is fixed to 3.4, see [this ticket](https://github.com/prisma-labs/nexus-prisma/issues/291#issuecomment-500809355)

# Nice to have
 - duplicate detection logic?
 - ES module build via [rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-commonjs)
 - plugin logic to add AWS support
